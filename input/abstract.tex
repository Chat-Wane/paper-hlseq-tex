  Distributed collaborative editors such as Google Docs or Etherpad allow to
  distribute the work across time, space and organizations. In this paper, we
  focus on distributed collaborative editors based on the Conflict-free
  Replicated Data Type approach (CRDT). CRDTs encompass a set of well-known
  data types such as sets, graphs, sequences, etc. CRDTs for sequences model a
  document as a set of elements (character, line, paragraph, etc.) with unique
  identifiers, providing two commutative update operations: insert and
  delete. The identifiers of elements can be either of fixed-size or
  variable-size. Recently, a strategy for assigning variable-size identifiers
  called LSEQ has been proposed for CRDTs for sequences. LSEQ lowers the space
  complexity of variable-size identifiers CRDTs from linear to
  sub-linear. While experiments show that it works locally, it fails to provide
  this bound with multiple users and latency. In this paper, we propose
  \NAME{}, an improvement of LSEQ that preserves its space complexity among
  multiple collaborators, regardless of the latency. Ultimately, this
  improvement allows to safely build distributed collaborative editors based on
  CRDTs. We validate our approach with simulations involving latency and
  multiple users.
