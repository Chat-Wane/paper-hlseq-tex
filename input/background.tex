Conflict-free Replicated Data Types belong to the optimistic
replication approach~\cite{saito2002replication,saito2005optimistic}. In the
context of distributed collaborative editing, the replicated data is a
document, where:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item each insert/delete operation is prepared locally and broadcast,
\item each remote replica receives and integrates the change,
\item all involved replicas eventually converge to an identical state.
\end{inparaenum}

To provide the convergence property, CRDTs for sequences model a document as a
set of couples $\langle elt, id\rangle$ where $id \in (\mathcal{I}, <_{id})$,
$<_{id}$ being a strict and dense total order, and $elt$ any element
(e.g. character, line, etc.). Two commutative operations allow to update the
document:
\begin{itemize}
\item $insert(p \in \mathcal{I}, elt, q \in \mathcal{I})$ that generates an
  identifier $id_{elt}$ with $p<id_{elt}<q$ and adds $\langle elt, id_{elt}
  \rangle$ to the document.
\item $delete(id_{elt})$ that removes $\langle elt, id_{elt}\rangle$ from the
  document.
\end{itemize} 

The variable-size identifiers
CRDTs~\cite{preguica2009commutative,weiss2009logoot} define identifiers as a
series of numbers that can designate paths in a tree. An allocation strategy is
in charge of choosing these sequences of numbers. It aims to keep these
identifiers as small as possible for the sake of performances.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\input{input/treeexample.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{Underlying 100-ary tree model of variable-size identifiers CRDTs. It
  contains 5 identifiers. 3 identifiers at depth-1: [20], [21], [50] and 2
  identifiers at depth-2: [20.10], [20.11]. For the sake of simplicity the
  element linked to identifiers are not displayed.}
\label{fig:treeexample}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:treeexample} illustrates the underlying model of variable-size
CRDTs.  If an insertion operation is performed at (1), the allocation strategy
chooses an identifier [X] with $50<X<99$. When the insert operation is
performed at (2), there is no room for another identifier, therefore, the new
identifier will be a sequence of three numbers: [20.10.X], where $0<X<100$.

These identifiers can grow linearly depending on the position of insert
operations.

Recently, LSEQ~\cite{nedelec2013lseq} lowered the space complexity of these
CRDTs from linear to sub-linear without favouring any editing behaviour. This
improvement aims to get rid of the previously mandatory garbage collecting
protocol. Three components compose LSEQ:
\begin{itemize}
\item{base doubling:} regarding the underlying tree model, each node can have
  twice more children than its parent. It follows the properties of exponential
  trees~\cite{andersson2007dynamic}.
\item{two antagonist allocation strategies:} \emph{boundary+} and
  \emph{boundary--} that are designed for end-edition and front-edition
  respectively.
\item{random strategy choice:} it randomly assigns an allocation strategy to
  each depth of the tree. It follows the intuition: \emph{since we have no
    prior knowledge of the editing behaviour, the strategy choice should not
    favor any editing behaviour. Consequently, the frequencies of appearance of
    each allocation strategy have to be equal.}
\end{itemize}

Despite the fact that numerous experimentation have been performed on LSEQ
including real documents extracted from Wikipedia, they did not include any
concurrency. Indeed, Wikipedia's revisions already present a serialization of
the document, without explicit concurrency. Although, the
paper~\cite{ahmed2011evaluating} highlighted the importance of such documents.

      10 users (bit/id) & 9.5 & 125.8 & 377.0 & 1962.1 & 5468.0 \\

    \caption{Experimentation on the average bit-length of LSEQ identifiers
      with 1 user and 10 collaborators generating a document of 10, 100, 200,
      500, and 1000 lines.}
    \label{tab:motivating}
  \end{center}
\end{table} 

Table~\ref{tab:motivating} shows the average bit-length of the identifiers
assigned by LSEQ on a synthetic document created by a single user and on a
synthetic document created by 10 users. Both documents were edited at the
end. We observe that while the identifiers resulting from a single author are
sub-linearly upper-bounded, the bit-length of identifiers generated by 10 users
are exponentially increasing.

\begin{Def}[Problem statement]
  Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a document on which n insert operations have been
  performed. Let $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{D}) = \{id|(\_, id) \in
  \mathcal{D}\}$. The function alloc($id_p$,$id_q$) should provide identifiers
  such as:
  \begin{center}
    $\sum\limits_{id \in \mathcal{I}} {{ log_2(id)}\over{n}} $ $< O(n)$
  \end{center}
\label{def:problem}
\end{Def}

Definition~\ref{def:problem} from~\cite{nedelec2013lseq} states the $alloc$
function property: a sub-linear upper-bound on the average bit-length of
identifiers. By excluding any reference to the two phases of optimistic
replication operations, it encompasses both the local generation of identifiers
and the integration of remote operations.  According to
Table~\ref{tab:motivating}, LSEQ only partially answers the problem statement.


The identified problem concerns the preservation of the space complexity of
LSEQ from single user to multiple users edition. Using multiple antagonist
strategies without any coordination between collaborators leads to an
exponential growth of identifiers. Consequently, providing this mechanism of
agreement in strategy choices would greatly improve LSEQ and other
composition of allocation strategies. Furthermore, such improvement would make
variable-size identifiers CRDTs actually usable in the distributed
collaborative editing context.
