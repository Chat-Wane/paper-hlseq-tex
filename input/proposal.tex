\label{sec:proposal}

The \NAME{} allocation strategy is mainly based on LSEQ, they differ in the
strategy choice component. Using LSEQ, each replica involved in the
collaboration makes independent random choices. However,
Section~\ref{sec:background} showed that such strategy fails to provide
sub-linearly upper-bounded identifiers in collaboration involving multiple
users.

The solution is to reach a global agreement over replicas on which is the
allocation strategy used at each depth of the underlying tree model. Since LSEQ
aims to get rid of protocols related to garbage collecting mechanisms, any
solution that requires additional communication is inconceivable.

We propose to use a hash strategy choice component which have the same local
behaviour than the original random strategy choice, but it also provides the
required implicit global agreement. Indeed, instead of synchronizing the set of
users, we provide an \emph{a priori} agreement by the mean of a hash
function. This agreement avoids the possibility of antagonist choices which
would have led to a bad global allocation of identifiers. Furthermore, it does
not introduce any additional cost to LSEQ.

\input{input/hashalgo.tex}

Algorithm~\ref{algo:hashstrategychoice} details the \NAME{} allocation
strategy. The changes over LSEQ are simply highlighted. This section explains
this algorithm. Extracted from~\cite{nedelec2013lseq}, the \emph{prefix}
function return a copy of the identifier $id$, i.e., a series of numbers
truncated at $depth$ or increased until $depth$. The function carefully encodes
each number of this copy in a base depending on its depth in order to directly
apply the arithmetic operations of line~\ref{line:add} and
line~\ref{line:sub}. For instance, assuming that the departure base is $2^5$, a
call to $prefix([13.42.37],2)$ encodes $[13.42]$ using $5+6$ bits.

The functions $boundary+$ and $boundary-$ are two allocation strategies, note
that they do not strictly respect the $alloc$ function signature in order to
factorize the computation of $depth$ and $step$.


\subsection{Locally}

The strategy choice function is surjective and its signature is: $h(depth \in
\mathbb{N}^*):\mathbb{N}$. The returned value corresponds to an allocation
strategy unique identifier. The algorithm of the allocation strategy \NAME{}
follows 3 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item lines~\ref{line:beginDepth}-\ref{line:endDepth}: computes the depth of
  the future identifiers to allocate
\item line~\ref{line:hash}: calls the strategy choice function $h$ using the
  depth
\item line~\ref{line:invoke}: calls the allocation strategy using the
  identifier returned by $h$
\end{enumerate}

The strategy choice function returns strategy identifiers following a uniform
law. Thus, frequencies of appearance of each strategy are equal and does not
favor any editing behaviour. Furthermore, the unpredictability due to
randomness preserves the model from intentional and malicious attacks.

The hash function fulfills the requirement of the strategy choice function $h$.
However, contrarily to the random strategy choice component, it requires
an initialization. Indeed, the creator of the document must share a hidden
seed (cf. line~\ref{line:seed}) within the document that each collaborator
will use to generate the hash function specific to this document. In
Algorithm~\ref{algo:hashstrategychoice} at line~\ref{line:random}, we simply
use the common random function initialized with the seed and the depth.

\subsection{Remotely}

Each collaborator generates the same hash function thanks to the shared
seed. Also, all collaborators use the same mapping $id\rightarrow
allocation\,strategy$ (cf. line~\ref{line:strategy}). Consequently, all hash
functions map the same depth to the same allocation strategies. The idea is to
reach a consensus on which strategies to employ in order to avoid the waste of
identifiers' space due to the choice of antagonist strategies.

\caption{Representation of the underlying exponential tree model of LSEQ and
  \NAME{}. Two collaborators insert two elements at the end of the document in
  order to get the sequence ``abcd''. On the random side, the collaborators
  employ antagonist strategies. On the hash side, the collaborators use the
  same allocation strategy. Both sides draw the same random numbers.}
\label{fig:hashexample}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:hashexample} highlights the differences between the original
random strategy choice and our hash strategy choice. Both cases present two
collaborators inserting 2 elements one after the other. The expected result is
the sequence ``abcd''. Hence, Collaborator 1 generates the ``a'' and ``c'' and
Collaborator 2 generates the ``b'' and ``d''. In both cases they draw the
same numbers. However, in the case of random strategy choice, one collaborator
randomly chooses \emph{boundary+} twice while the other randomly chooses
\emph{boundary--} twice. When the editing behaviour is monotonic, the size of
identifiers quickly grows. On the opposite, the collaborators using \NAME{}
implicitly agree on using \emph{boundary+} at depth-1, consequently the
allocation follows the properties of the one user edition presented
in~\cite{nedelec2013lseq}.

The next section aims to corroborate our assumptions by performing experiments
on different setups with varying the number of collaborators and the latency of
the network.
