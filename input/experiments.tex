\label{sec:experiments}

This section is composed of two parts. First, the experimentation focuses on
the influence of the number of collaborators on the size of LSEQ and \NAME{}
identifiers.  A set of synthetic collaborators generates a document by
successively performing insert operations at the end. This experiment aims to
show the behaviour of the two strategy choices, and compare the results with
the expected sub-linear space complexity.

The second part of experiments consists in highlighting the effect of latency
on a document edited by multiple users. Once again, it aims to compare LSEQ and
\NAME{} and to show the impact of concurrency on the average size of
identifiers in the document.

The experiments focus on the digit bit-length of generated identifiers.
Indeed, all variable-size CRDTs rely on source and clock to guarantee the
unicity of identifiers, nevertheless, the space complexity mainly depends on
the digit choice made by the allocation strategy.

To perform these experiments, we implemented a simulation framework called
\emph{HumbleSimulator}. The sources are available on the Github platform under
the terms of the GPL

\subsection{Multiple users experiment}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] show that the random strategy choice without taking into
  account the strategies employed by other collaborators leads to a quick
  growth in the size of identifiers. On the opposite, when all collaborators
  uses a common allocation strategy at a given depth, the space complexity
  remains sub-linearly upper-bounded.

\item[Description:] we evaluate LSEQ and \NAME{} strategies on a group of 10
  collaborators. Thus, the setups are
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item a random strategy choice (\textbf{rand}) and
  \item a hash strategy choice (\textbf{hash}).
  \end{inparaenum}
  Both of these setups use \emph{boundary+} and \emph{boundary--} and have
  the same variable values $boundary=10$ and $base=2^{4+depth}$. A set of 10
  collaborators produces a document of 100 lines by performing 10 insert
  operations each.

\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{im:tenusers} shows on the top part the spectrum of
  the synthetic document, i.e., the revision date of each line. Since the bars
  are getting taller when they are closer of the end of the document, it
  indicates that the users edited at the end monotonically. On the second part
  of the Figure~\ref{im:tenusers}, it shows the identifier bit-length
  associated to each line. We observe that the identifiers of \textbf{rand}
  setup quickly increase while the \textbf{hash} identifiers remain similar to
  the ones in the experiment made for one user
  in~\cite{nedelec2013lseq}. Consequently, the \textbf{hash} setup is the most
  suitable setup in the context of distributed collaborative editing.

\item[Reasons:] both setups use \emph{boundary+} and \emph{boundary--}
  allocation strategies. However, each collaborator in the \textbf{rand} setup
  makes independent choices of allocation strategies when required. Thus, if a
  collaborator chooses a particular strategy, and another user chooses the
  antagonist strategy, then a large number of identifiers is wasted when their
  operations are delivered to each other. On the other hand, when the same hash
  function spread over all collaborators generates the same strategy choices,
  it keeps the random behaviour locally and also makes an implicit agreement on
  which strategy to employ at any given depth.

  revision number of the operation. The bottom figure shows the bit-length of
  each identifier allocated to each line. On average, the bit-length of LSEQ
  and \NAME{} identifiers are 94.7 and 39.1 bit/id respectively.}

\subsection{Latency experiment}
\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] show that increasing the latency, i.e., the time between the
  generation and the delivery of an operation, does not imply a growth in the
  size of identifiers. On the contrary, when the latency increases, the average
  size of allocated identifiers decreases. This behaviour is expected for LSEQ
  and \NAME{} strategies.
\item[Description:] we simulate the production of a 100 lines document by a set
  of 10 collaborators. Each one of these collaborators performs 10 insert
  operations at the end of the document. The users generate operations
  following the Poisson distribution of parameter $\lambda=100$, i.e., users
  more likely generate an operation after 100 rounds (arbitrary unit) from
  their previous operation. Measurements are done at a latency of 5, 10, 20,
  40, 80, 160, 320, 640 rounds. They concern the average bit-length of
  identifiers in the document.  We evaluate two setups: the random strategy
  choice (\textbf{rand}) and the hash strategy choice (\textbf{hash}). Both
  setups use the allocation strategies $boundary+$ and $boundary-$ with
  $boundary=10$ and departure $base=2^{4+depth}$.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{im:stats} shows the results of the latency
  experiments. As expected, the two setups allocate identifiers with an average
  bit-length that quickly decreases when the latency increases. Therefore, the
  latency does not badly affect LSEQ and \NAME{} allocation strategies. Also,
  it confirms observations made in the previous experiment: \textbf{hash}
  performs better than \textbf{rand}, especially under low latency.
\item[Reasons:] increasing the latency delays the arrival of operations to the
  remote collaborators. Thus, each collaborator works locally until operations
  generated by other users are delivered. Considering the extreme case with the
  maximum latency, each collaborator generates his 10 insertions, and then
  merges the others' 90 operations. Consequently, the 100 operations share the
  same space, i.e., the digit part of identifiers can be the same for multiple
  elements, and the total order is maintained by the source and clock.
\end{asparadesc}

  i.e., the average time between the send and the receive of an operation. The
  y-axis shows the average bit-length of identifiers. A group of 10
  collaborators generates a synthetic document of 100 lines by performing 10
  operations each. Two configurations of LSEQ: the original random strategy
  choice and the hash strategy choice (\NAME{}).}

\subsection{Synthesis}
The experiments evaluated the effect of concurrency on the average bit-length
of identifiers by varying the number of collaborators and the latency. They
showed that an implicit and \emph{a priori} agreement on allocation strategy
choice is required to maintain the sub-linear upper-bound on space
complexity. Employing the same hash function to choose the allocation strategy
permits to reach this agreement. Consequently, the improvement of LSEQ called
\NAME{} can be safely used in distributed collaborative editing. The latency
experiment shows that increasing the latency parameter only results in sharing
the identifier space, and consequently lowers the size of identifiers. As a
corollary, considering an immediate delivery of operations constitutes an
upper-bound on the behaviour of the overall system for any latency.
